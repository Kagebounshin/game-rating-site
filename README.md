- ### Strategy

    - This site focuses on the gamers, one of the larges growing community in the world. During this recent pandemic, lots of gaming companys has delayed there games. So there hasn't been to many new games that has been released. So by shortage of something to play, I started my backlog. I looked at the games I missed or didn't have time to finish. And I made my own list. So the reason for this website to even exist is for you to keep track on your own perosnal backlog. And when you are done with the game, you can leave a short review of your experience, for other users to see.
- ### Scope
    - So the users of this site should be able to create an account, add to there own backlog, review there finished games & look on other users reviews. More features will be to add a link to where you can buy the games. 

- ### Structure
- Navbar
    - At the top of the page I will have a navbar so you can easily navigate around the site. 
    - On smaller devices the navbar links will collapse into a toggler menu. With a button to reveal the links in a good looking [sidenav](static/img/img-readme/mobileSidenav.png).
- Home
    - At first you will see the page header, A short description on what the site is about, and then you can choose to Register an account or Log in. 

- Review
    - When you are done with a game, review the game and it will be for everybody to see at this page. Viewing the newest to oldest reviews.
- My page
    - At this page you will store your backlog in a list. 
    - Also displayed in a list would be yor finished games.
    - Underneath your own reviews, from newest to oldest.
- Register
    - A easyly understanable register page, centered in the middle of the page. Come up with a nickname, enter a password, and you are ready to start your backlog. 
- Log In
    - Just enter your nickname and password and your are good to go. Will have simular styling as the register page. 
- Add to Backlog
    - At this page you will add games to your backlog.
    - You type in the name of your game, and it will be stores in your backlog.
