- ### Strategy
    - This site will have it's focus on the gamers, one of the larges growing community in the world. 
    - During this recent pandemic, lots of gaming companies has delayed there games. So there hasn't been to many new games released. So by shortage of something to play, I started my own backlog. With just pen and paper. I looked at the games I missed or didn't have time to finish and started to write them down. So that was the main idea for this website, keep track . 
    - The reason for this website is for you to keep better track on your own perosnal backlog. Just add your games to your list. And when you are done, you can leave a review of your experience, for other users to see.
    
---

- ### Structure
- Navbar
    - At the top of the page I will have a navbar so you can easily navigate around the site. 
    - On smaller devices the navbar links will collapse into a toggler menu. With a button to reveal the links in a good looking [sidenav](static/img/img-readme/mobileSidenav.png).
- Home
    - At first you will see the page header, A short description on what the site is about, and then you can choose to Register an account or Log in. 
- Review Page
    - At the review page you will see other users reviews as well as our own, displaying from newest to oldest post. You will also be able to search for reviews in a searchbar. 
- My page
    - At this page you will store your backlog in a list. 
    - Also displayed in a list would be yor finished games.
    - Underneath those lists you can see your own reviews, in an order from newest to oldest.
    - When you are done with a game, review the game and it will be for everybody to see at the review page.
- Register
    - A easily understandable register page, centered in the middle of the page. Come up with a nickname, enter a password, and you are ready to start your backlog. 
- Log In
    - Will have the same estetics as the register page.

- ### Surface

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The background color of the site, navbar and the about-section, the inside of the card at the backlog, finished backlog, sign up and sign in is set to a basic white color ([#ffffff](static/img/img-readme/ffffff.png)). 
        - Basically all the sections (except the footer and the about-section on the index page), has a light-grey ([#f0f0f0](static/img/img-readme/f0f0f0.png))  background color. 
        - The footer of the page has a dark grey ([#1f1f1f](static/img/img-readme/1f1f1f.png)) background color. 
        - My overall thoughts with this background color layout was that the color should gradually decrease in brightness, you start with the white, then the light grey, and at the footer is the dark grey. 
        - Where there is a white or lightgrey background color, the text color is set to the same dark grey color ([#1f1f1f](static/img/img-readme/1f1f1f.png)) as the footer. 
        - And at the footer the text is set to the same light-grey color ([#f0f0f0](static/img/img-readme/f0f0f0.png)) as in the most of the sections.
        - When you hover the anchor links at the page they ease in to a to a lilac color ([#850866](static/img/img-readme/850866.png)) with a underline. But at the footer the anchor links and social icons ease in to a yellow ([#ffcc00](static/img/img-readme/ffcc00.png)) color.  
        - The backlog has two icons after the game title, a "Check" icon and a "Delete" icon, when hovered the "Check" icon it eases in to a green ([#3e913e](static/img/img-readme/3e913e.png)) color. The "Delete" icon eases in to a red ([#b42020](static/img/img-readme/b42020.png)) color. 
        - The horizontal lines at the review page and the fullreview page has a slightly darker color then the light grey background. They have the color ([#7b7b6e](static/img/img-readme/7b7b6e.png)).
        In the reviews before you got to the fullreview page, has a text at the top wich just says "Reviews", that text is set to the same color as most of the anchor links, the lilac ([#850866](static/img/img-readme/850866.png)). But if hovered it get a slightly lighter lilac ([#b10e88](static/img/img-readme/b10e88.png))color 
        - The horizontal line just benath the header at the profile page is set to the color (black [#000000](static/img/img-readme/000000.png)) and fades out at the edges. 
        - The ["Back to the Top"](static/img/img-readme/additional01.png) button, has the same yellow ([#ffcc00](static/img/img-readme/ffcc00.png)) as the anchor links at the footer and the pacman images in the logo and at the navbar. But when hovered it get a slightly darker yellow ([#d8ad00](static/img/img-readme/d8ad00.png)) color. 
    -   #### Typography
        - The Fonts I've used for this site are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The ones I've used are "Open Sans" and "Press Start 2P". 
            - ["Open Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans#about) is the main font for the page. I've choosed this font because it has a clean and readable look to it. Nice to have for informative text, and when you're typing.  
            - The font used for header across the page has the ["Press Start 2P"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?query=press+) font. When I first saw this font, my mind went immediately to games. So just by having this font as the main header of the page, you'll get a hint of what the site is about. 
    -   #### Imagery
        - For the navbrand, the site logo and the favicon I've used a image of [Pacman](static/img/pacman.png). Pacman is one of the most iconic game characters of all time, so I thought he would be perfect for this page, wich purpose is about games. For the site logo, I've put the image of pacman instead of the letter "O".
        - Images are also used in the reviews. The purpose for those images is to show something from the game you reviewed.

- Admin 
    - Late in the development process I made an Admin page. At this page the admin can see all the [users](static/img/img-readme/admin01.png) in alphabetical order. The admin also has the power to Edit and/or Delete user reviews. Thought that would be a good idea if a user should for some reason, write something inaprproprate or add an inaprproprate image. The [reviews](static/img/img-readme/admin02.png) are also displayed in alphabetical order. 

- Footer
    - The footer looks the same across all the pages. You can send me an mail just by clicking the [Email](static/img/img-readme/footer01.png) under the "Get In Touch" header. Under the header "Social Media" you can visit my github, linkedIn or Instagram by clicking any of the [icons](static/img/img-readme/footer02.png). 

- Additional Features
    - When scrolling down on any of the pages a Back to the Top [button](static/img/img-readme/additional01.png) appears in the bottom right corner of the screen. Click it if you think you have scrolled down to far, and you get back to the top of the page. 


### Features for the future 

- I would like to add backlog opportunities for movies, and TV Series, wich you also could be reviewed when your done them watching. 
- A more complex rating system. For example gather up all the ratings for one game, and combine the score to make an overall rating.
- A top list for the games with the highest/lowest rating score. 
- A chance for the users to retrive/change their lost usernames or passwords.
- Connect the site to a video game database, such as [RAWG](https://rawg.io/). For example to make the adding to your backlog process easier. You would only need to click on the game that you want to add, and the choose to add it to your backlog.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

---

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. "I would like to get a introduction on what the site is about, what I can do."
        - When I enter the site, first thing I see is a header with some explaining text underneath. Wich explains the soul purpose for this page. 
        If thats not enough I find an about section abit further down the home page. 
    2. I would like to easily navigate my way through the site.  
        - I can easily navigate between the pages at the top of the site using the navbar. When shown on small & medium devieces the navbar collapses into a burger menu, wich when clicked appears to the left of the screen.
    3. I want the registration process to be smooth and availible. 
        - When I enter the site, just below the header there is a "Sign Up" button, I click that button an it takes me to the sign up page. I click on the "Sign Up" button, the username input field tells me that a need to fill out that field first. So I choose a username that I know exists in the database. A message at the top of the page appears, saying that this "username already exists". So I enter a new username, using only four letters. The username input field tells me to match the requested format. So I choose another username with five letters and I click the "Sign Up" button. The password input field tells me that I need to fill in a password. So I enter a four letter password, the password input field tells me to match the requested format. So I enter my username and password correctly and I end up on my new profile page, greated with a message at the top of the page, saying that the registration was a success.

I click the "Sign In" button, and then the username field tells me that I need to fill in that field first. So I enter my username in that field and then I click the "Sign In" button again. The password field tells me that I also need to fill that field. So I enter the wrong password and I click the "Sign In" button. A message appears at the top of the page. Saying the either my username or password was incorrect. So now I enter the correct username and password, and I'm greated with a welcome message at my profile page.

        I click the "X" icon to the right of the game I want to delete. A modal pops up, asking if I really want to delete the game. I do want to delete the game. I click on the "Yes" button. The game gets deleted, never to be seen again.  
    5. I want to have the choice to review my finshed game, and let others see my reviews.
        - I'm done with a game so I clicked the "Check" icon to the right of that game title. The game ends up in a "Finished" list next to my backlog. Now If I click that game title in that list I end up on the add review page. I dont want to add a review right now, so a click the "Cancel" button, and I'm back at my profile page. 
        - Now I want to add a review, so I click the game title I want to review in my "Finished" list and now I'm at the add review page. I try to click the "Add Review" without filling out any of the fields. That dosen't work, I need to fill out every field before a can add my review. I do so, I fill every field and add a picture at the bottom. I click the "Add Review" button. I end up at the reviews page, seeing that my newly added review is at the top of the page. I go back top my profile page to see that my review has been added there as well, and beneath the backlog and the finished list is my newly added review. 
    6. I want the option the edit my reviews. 
        - At my profile page, down where I can see my own reviews, I can locate a Edit button on the reviews, I Choose a review a want to edit, I click the "Edit" link, and I end up on an edit review page. I review the input value from on of the fields and click the "Edit" button. That field urges me to fill it out if I want to be able to finish my editing. A refill that field and I'm happy with the changes. So I click on the "Edit" button. A messages appears at the top, saying that the update was a success. I navigate my way back using the navbar, or by clicking the "Cancel" button. 
        - I click on the edit button for a review. But I dont want to edit the game at all. I just click the "Cancel" button and I'm back at my profile page. 
    7. I want  the option to delete my reviews. 
        - I locate the review I like to delete at my profile page. At the bottom of each ones of my reviews I can locate a "Delete" link. I click that link, A modal appears asking me if I really want to delete that review. I do want to delete it, so I click on the "Yes" Button. And the review is deleted.
        - I clicked the "Delete" link by accident, a modal popped up asking if I really want to delete this review. I dont want to do that, so I click the "No" button.
    8. I would want to add pictures to my review. 
        - The input field at the bottom of the add review form is where I can add my picture. I can add a pictures by clicking at the button to the left of the input field. I the picture I want to add. If all the other fields are filled, I can click the "Add Review" button. 
    9. I would like to search for a specific game review, to see other users thought on that game.
        - I locate the reviews page at the top of the navbar. Just below the page header is an input field. To the right of that field is two button, one has a "Search" icon, and the other says "Reset". I click on the search button without filling out the input field. The input field urgest me to fill it out before clicking the "Search" Button. I do so, I type in what I like to search for, I mostly play on the PC so I want to see reviews for PC  games. I type in the word "PC" and click the search button. The search results shows me the reviews with the matching platform choice of "PC". I'm done searching I click the "Reset" button and the page does just that. 
        - I search for a word I know doesn't exist in the search base. A message get displayed below the search field saying "No Results Found". I click the "Reset" button and the page does just that.
    10. I would like to contact the creator if I've encounter any problems with the site.
        - Down at the footer is a contact section with an email adress. If I click the email address a new e-mail opens up with the address already filled in. I add a subject, write whats o my mind and the click send. 

### Further Testing

- Tested the links alot, to see if they behave as they should. 
- This project was tested different webbrowsers, Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge, Safari.
- This project was tested different devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Ipad, Iphone 12 Pro, Iphone X, Iphone 8.
- Friend & Family members has tested the site, looking for bugs and other issues.

### Known Bugs 

- A bug I've encountered is at the edit-review page, I've preloaded the image field with it's current [value](static/img/img-readme/bug03.png), but if I don't load the same or a new images I get an error. ["Missing required parameter - file"](static/img/img-readme/bug02.png).


### Resolved Bugs

- When [deleting](static/img/img-readme/bug05.png) an object from your backlog, the one that is at the top of the list gets [deleted](static/img/img-readme/bug05.png), not the one that I've choosed. The problem came once I've added a modal wich just checks if you really want to delete the current object. If I remove the modal, then it's back to normal, the choosen object gets deleted. Went to slack, figured that somebody have had this problem before, and yes. So it basically generates a modal for every item in the loop.
Becouse I didn't give each modal and a link instance a unique id, it just always triggers one and the same modal the first modal in the loop, so thats why the top object always got deleted. So by adding [{{loop.index}}](static/img/img-readme/bugResolved01.png) to the modal ID both in the a link and modal. Each object in the backlog got it'
s own unique ID.

- So the first bug i've encounterd was when opening the sidenav on my iPhone X, at the users profile page. The pacman image looked like [this](static/img/img-readme/bug01.png). Only the alt text is showing. Now in late develepment I also used the pacman images as the navbrand and encountered the same problem, the navbrand image and the sidenav images dosen't show at the profile page, fullreview page, when you edit your backlog or when your about to write a review or edit your review. The difference between these pages are that these pages has an argument passed through the URL. The profile page has username, edit-backlog has backlog_id, fullreview has review_id and edit-review also has review_id passed through as an argumenet. By changing the src to the images address from my cloudninary instead of the img folder in my static files. The problem was no more.
