---

- ### Strategy
    - This site focuses on the gamers, one of the larges growing community in the world. During this recent pandemic, lots of gaming companies has delayed there games. So there hasn't been to many new games released. So by shortage of something to play, I started my backlog. With just pen and paper. I looked at the games I missed or didn't have time to finish and started to write them down. So the reason for this website is for you to keep better track on your own perosnal backlog. Just add your games to your list. And when you are done, you can leave a short review of your experience, for other users to see.

---

- ### Scope
    
    - So the users of this site should be able to create an account, add to there own backlog, review there finished games & look on other users reviews and backlogs. More features will be to add a link to where you can buy the games. 

---

- ### Structure
- Navbar
    - At the top of the page I will have a navbar so you can easily navigate around the site. 
    - On smaller devices the navbar links will collapse into a toggler menu. With a button to reveal the links in a good looking [sidenav](static/img/img-readme/mobileSidenav.png).
- Home
    - At first you will see the page header, A short description on what the site is about, and then you can choose to Register an account or Log in. 
- Review Page
    - At the review page you will see other users reviews as well as our own, displaying from newest to oldest post. 
    - 
- My page
    - At this page you will store your backlog in a list. 
    - Also displayed in a list would be yor finished games.
    - Underneath those lists you can see your own reviews, in an order from newest to oldest.
    - When you are done with a game, review the game and it will be for everybody to see at this page. Viewing the newest to oldest reviews.
    - The reviews will be stored in mongoDB.
- Register
    - A easily understanable register page, centered in the middle of the page. Come up with a nickname, enter a password, and you are ready to start your backlog. 
- Log In
    - Will have the same estetics as the register page. 
    - Just enter your nickname and password and your are good to go. Will have simular styling as the register page.

- ### Surface

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The background color of the site, navbar and the about-section, the inside of the card at the backlog, finished backlog, sign up and sign in is set to a basic white color ([#ffffff](static/img/img-readme/ffffff.png)). 
        - Basically all the sections (except the footer and the about-section on the index page), has a light-grey ([#f0f0f0](static/img/img-readme/f0f0f0.png))  background color. 
        - The footer of the page has a dark grey ([#1f1f1f](static/img/img-readme/1f1f1f.png)) background color. 
        - My overall thoughts with this background color layout was that the color should gradually decrease in brightness, you start with the white, then the light grey, and at the footer is the dark grey. 
        - Where there is a white or lightgrey background color, the text color is set to the same dark grey color ([#1f1f1f](static/img/img-readme/1f1f1f.png)) as the footer. 
        - And at the footer the text is set to the same light-grey color ([#f0f0f0](static/img/img-readme/f0f0f0.png)) as in the most of the sections.
        - When you hover the anchor links at the page they ease in to a to a lilac color ([#850866](static/img/img-readme/850866.png)) with a underline. But at the footer the anchor links and social icons ease in to a yellow ([#ffcc00](static/img/img-readme/ffcc00.png)) color.  
        - The backlog has two icons after the game title, a "Check" icon and a "Delete" icon, when hovered the "Check" icon it eases in to a green ([#3e913e](static/img/img-readme/3e913e.png)) color. The "Delete" icon eases in to a red ([#b42020](static/img/img-readme/b42020.png)) color. 
        - The horizontal lines at the review page and the fullreview page has a slightly darker color then the light grey background. They have the color ([#7b7b6e](static/img/img-readme/7b7b6e.png)).
        In the reviews before you got to the fullreview page, has a text at the top wich just says "Reviews", that text is set to the same color as most of the anchor links, the lilac ([#850866](static/img/img-readme/850866.png)). But if hovered it get a slightly lighter lilac ([#b10e88](static/img/img-readme/b10e88.png))color 
        - The horizontal line just benath the header at the profile page is set to the color (black [#000000](static/img/img-readme/000000.png)) and fades out at the edges. 
        - The ["Back to the Top"](static/img/img-readme/additional01.png) button, has the same yellow ([#ffcc00](static/img/img-readme/ffcc00.png)) as the anchor links at the footer and the pacman images in the logo and at the navbar. But when hovered it get a slightly darker yellow ([#d8ad00](static/img/img-readme/d8ad00.png)) color. 
    -   #### Typography
        - The Fonts I've used for this site are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The ones I've used are "Open Sans" and "Press Start 2P". 
            - ["Open Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans#about) is the main font for the page. I've choosed this font because it has a clean and readable look to it. Nice to have for informative text, and when you're typing.  
            - The font used for header across the page has the ["Press Start 2P"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?query=press+) font. When I first saw this font, my mind went immediately to games. So just by having this font as the main header of the page, you'll get a hint of what the site is about. 
    -   #### Imagery
        - For the navbrand, the site logo and the favicon I've used a image of [Pacman](static/img/pacman.png). Pacman is one of the most iconic game characters of all time, so I thought he would be perfect for this page, wich purpose is about games. For the site logo, I've put the image of pacman instead of the letter "O".
        - Images are also used in the reviews. The purpose for those images is to show something from the game you reviewed.

- A top list for the games with the highest/lowest rating score. 
- Connect the site to a video game database, such as [RAWG](https://rawg.io/). For example to make the adding to your backlog process easier. You would only need to click on the game that you want to add, and the choose to add it to your backlog.

### Further Testing

### Known Bugs 

- Another bug I've encountered is at the edit-review page, I've preloaded the image field with it's current [value](static/img/img-readme/bug03.png), but if I don't load the same or a new images I get an error. ["Missing required parameter - file"](static/img/img-readme/bug02.png).


### Resolved Bugs

- When [deleting](static/img/img-readme/bug05.png) an object from your backlog, the one that is at the top of the list gets [deleted](static/img/img-readme/bug05.png), not the one that I've choosed. The problem came once I've added a modal wich just checks if you really want to delete the current object. If I remove the modal, then it's back to normal, the choosen object gets deleted. Went to slack, figured that somebody have had this problem before, and yes. So it basically generates a modal for every item in the loop.
Becouse I didn't give each modal and a link instance a unique id, it just always triggers one and the same modal the first modal in the loop, so thats why the top object always got deleted. So by adding [{{loop.index}}](static/img/img-readme/bugResolved01.png) to the modal ID both in the a link and modal. Each object in the backlog got it'
s own unique ID.

- So the first bug i've encounterd was when opening the sidenav on my iPhone X, at the users profile page. The pacman image looked like [this](static/img/img-readme/bug01.png). Only the alt text is showing. Now in late develepment I also used the pacman images as the navbrand and encountered the same problem, the navbrand image and the sidenav images dosen't show at the profile page, fullreview page, when you edit your backlog or when your about to write a review or edit your review. The difference between these pages are that these pages has an argument passed through the URL. The profile page has username, edit-backlog has backlog_id, fullreview has review_id and edit-review also has review_id passed through as an argumenet. By changing the src to the images address from my cloudninary instead of the img folder in my static files. The problem was no more. 

## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
